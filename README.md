### Limitation: 
We couldn't find a data source that could present old articles that relate to stocks prices.  This is why our graphs focus on 1 year of data.

We also faced request limits when using an api for articles that showcase in real time the sentiment of the market.  With more funding for a premium plan an ETL pipeline could've been finished.
